* The "Remember checkout fields" function will allow your customers to refresh the checkout page after entering their information and walk around the page without losing previously entered data in the checkout form. Please note that this feature is enabled only for users who haven't logged in - WooCommerce takes care of this for authorized users.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When is the cart and checkout form data saved?

Data and information about the cart is saved right after the user gets to the Checkout form and one of the following events happen:

* Correct email address is entered
* Phone number is entered
* On Checkout page load if email or phone number input fields are already filled
* Any Checkout form input field with a class "input-text" is entered or changed if a valid Email or Phone number has been entered

If ghost carts have been enabled, the cart will be saved as soon as the user adds an item to his cart. It will remain as a ghost cart until one of the above events has occurred.

In case a user is logged in, the shopping cart will be instantly captured as soon as an item is added to the cart. After this, the cart will be instantly updated if it is altered or an item is removed from the cart.

If a customer completes the checkout process and arrives on the WooCommerce "Thank you" page, the cart is removed from the abandoned cart table and the Checkout form fields are cleared.

### When would a cart be considered as abandoned?

Once the cart is saved, it is considered as abandoned after a period of 60 minutes. Email notifications will be sent out only after the cart is abandoned.

### What are ghost carts, how do they work and how to use them?

Ghost cart is a cart that canâ€™t be identified since the customer has neither signed in your store nor he has entered his email / phone in your checkout form or Exit intent popup.

Any customer who is unidentifiable and adds anything to his shopping cart instantly appears in CartBounty cart list as a ghost shopping cart. If during his shopping journey he adds his details, his ghost cart automatically is turned into a recoverable cart.

There can be many different reasons why you would like to see ghost cart data, here are a couple of ideas:

* Monitor live cart activity in your store and have a better overview of what is happening in your store
* See which products are being placed into shopping carts to know which are products are trending and what your customers are interested in
* Manually analyze which products are being placed into the cart, but not getting purchased
* Knowledge about the potential revenue that is missed out

If you would rather not see ghost carts, you can exclude them from being saved in your CartBounty settings tab.

### How do the email notifications work?

Once the cart is saved and is considered as abandoned, you will receive a notification about it in your email. You will not be notified about previously abandoned carts.

You can set the following notification intervals:

* Every 10 minutes
* Every 20 minutes
* Every 30 minutes
* Every hour
* Every 2 hours
* Every 3 hours
* Every 4 hours
* Every 5 hours
* Every 6 hours
* Twice a day
* Once a day
* Once every 2 days
* Disable notifications

Default notification interval is "Every hour". You also have the option to disable notifications in case you ever get tired of them ;)

Please also note how WordPress handles Cron job that is responsible for sending out email notifications. Scheduled actions can only be triggered when a visitor arrives on a WordPress site. Therefore, if you are not getting any traffic on your website you will not receive any email notifications until a visitor lands on your website.

By default, notifications will be sent to WordPress registered admin email. But you can also set a different email address.

### How does Exit Intent Technology work?

If a user tries to leave your shop with an abandoned cart, just before leaving, he will be presented with an additional form that will ask for his email address. Once it is entered (no need to submit the form), user's cart will be automatically captured and labeled as recoverable.

Exit Intent form will be displayed only to unregistered users once per hour. If the user enters his email address either in Exit Intent form or in the Checkout form - popup will no longer be displayed upon leaving your shop.

If you would like to test the visual appearance of Exit Intent, please check the "Enable Test Mode" checkbox. Please note that only users with Admin rights will be able to see Exit Intent during this stage and appearance limits will be removed. This means that it will be showed to the Admin each time he tries to leave the shop.

### How to change the contents of Exit Intent popup?

If you would like to make adjustments to the default contents of Exit Intent, you can use either [actions and filters](https://www.cartbounty.com/#actions-and-filters) that we have provided for you or use our Exit Intent template file to make the necessary adjustments.

You can find the Exit Intent template file inside "/plugins/woo-save-abandoned-carts/templates/cartbounty-exit-intent.php". This template file contains markup required to display the popup and to capture the Abandoned cart prior the user leaves your shop. Please copy this template to your shops theme to keep your customization intact after plugin updates.

You can copy this template file to either one of these locations:

* yourtheme/templates/cartbounty-exit-intent.php
* yourtheme/cartbounty-exit-intent.php

When modifying our template, please do not change the ID #cartbounty-exit-intent-email of the email input field. If changed, the plugin will not be able to capture abandoned carts using Exit Intent form.

### How to prevent bots from leaving ghost carts?

If you have noticed unusual amounts of multiple new ghost carts being left almost in the same time, from one country and consisting of a single product, it might be that they are left by bots who are visiting your store.

Bots can be divided into two groups â€“ good ones and bad ones.

* Good bots. The most common example of a good bot could be a web crawler. It is a bot that is sent via a search engine like Google to index your shop. Online store owners generally welcome these bots, because it keeps their content and products visible in the search engine results and hopefully will attract new visitors
* Harmful bots. These bots are visiting your store for malicious purposes. Their actions range from mildly harmful to potentially critical. Bad bots are scanning your store for weak spots, security holes, ways to take over your store, steal your visitor credit card data etc. Besides that, they are also increasing stress on your server thus slowing down your store

Harmful bots are the ones that might be responsible for leaving new ghost carts on your website. While this is not dangerous, it can be frustrating and annoying. Here are three solutions that will help you to deal to with them:

1. The quick solution is to simply disable ghost carts from being saved by CartBounty. You can do this in the CartBounty Settings tab. As easy as this solution is, it only deals with consequences and does not stop these harmful bots from visiting your store, continuously searching for new vulnerabilities and slowing down your shop
1. A better solution would be to install a WordPress plugin that helps to prevent bots from visiting your store. You could try out a couple of different plugins, but this might be a good starting point: [Blackhole for Bad Bots](https://wordpress.org/plugins/blackhole-bad-bots). This way you will block harmful bots from wandering around your store and keep ghost carts enabled to see what your customers are shopping for
1. If you would not like to install a new plugin and you have a developer who is able to help, you could try this solution. At first you will have to find your server access logs and find which of these entries have been left by bots. After that you can use .htaccess file to block these bots from further visits. Here is a good article [Block bad bots](https://perishablepress.com/block-bad-bots) which will provide in depth steps on doing this

### WooCommerce order "Failed", but no abandoned cart saved?

Once a user reaches WooCommerce "Thank you" page - the abandoned cart is automatically removed from the table since the cart is no longer considered as abandoned (regardless of the order status). In this case you can see all of the submitted user data under WooCommerce > Orders.
